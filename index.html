    <p>Matariki celebrations seem to have popped up on the Kiwi calendar recently, as a time to gather and celebrate in the middle of our chilly winter. It’s always a very special time of year for us at Tamaki – steeped in celebration and legends, it’s something our ancestors saw as the ‘highlight’ on the calendar! If you’re new to NZ, or new to our culture, here’s the low-down on what we’re actually celebrating: What is Matariki? </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Matariki is a Star Cluster that Maori Used to Predict the Weather</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Matariki is a smattering of stars that are also known as the Seven Sisters. For Māori, looking to the skies has always proven a smart way to ask nature about it’s secrets. The stars helped guide our ancestors, who were master navigators, on great sea voyages in waka (canoes).  During winter, Māori again looked to Matariki to see how the weather for the season ahead would be. If the stars shone bright, it bode well for the season ahead; if they were dull, it meant months of hard work and hungry bellies. </p>
